{Stipple Effect} is a pixel art editor that supports animation and scripting. It is designed to
facilitate a variety of workflows and to encourage rapid, iterative creation of video game art assets
and other types of artwork.

> made by a solo game developer with the needs and skill sets of other indie devs in mind
> lightweight and simple to learn and use, yet allows for considerable depth and complexity
> expressive scripting API that can be used to {automate program actions} and {create dynamic preview}
  {and color transformations with complex logic}

{Technical:}
Stipple Effect runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and is built on top of {Delta Time}, the developer's
proprietary Java game library, which handles most of the rendering boilerplate, menu element logic,
and other low-level systems and behaviours.
